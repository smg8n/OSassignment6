INTRODUCTION
------------
The goal of this homework is to implement a memory management module for our Operating System Simulator oss.

COMPILATION
-----------
To compile, open a new CLI window, change the 
directory nesting your module. Type:

  make
  
To remove object files,type:
  make clean
  
EXECUTION
---------

To run it simply type: ./oss

Options

       -h : display help menu
       -m x : specify memory request scheme either 0 or 1

The output log file is log.txt

msg1 , msg2 , shmfile are three different files created to generate keys for shared memory.

Decription:
-----------

Among two memory request schemes, 1st memory scheme requests memory randomly and is more thoretical and ideal
while the 2nd memory scheme requests with basis of weightage and is more synchronized.

Version Control
